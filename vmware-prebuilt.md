# Deploy the pre-built VM template on VMware

This guide explains how to use our pre-built template to set up a new virtual machine (VM) dedicated to the Service Edge (SE) function within your VMware infrastructure.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Locate pre-built VM template**  
   The latest VM template is located in [release section](https://github.com/appaegis/bootstrap/releases/latest).

   Our pre-built VM template is based on most recent Ubuntu LTS optimized for cloud. For example, the [`Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)`](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/) page and note the URL of the [`OVA build`](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.ova).

   We also install the latest docker engine, docker-compose and our latest container image.

1. **(Optional) Download the OVA File**  
   Downloading the OVA file is optional, since some VMware products allow you to load the OVA directly using its URL.

1. **Create the Virtual Machine**  
   - Use the downloaded OVA file or the OVA URL to create the VM.  
   - During setup, provide the bootstrapping string (Base64 encoded) as the user data.  
     - Obtain the bootstrapping string from the **"Networking â†’ Service Edges"** section of the Mammoth Cyber Management Portal.  
     - **Important:** Since the bootstrapping string contains unique identifiers, do not reuse it unless replacing an existing SE after stopping it. Treat the bootstrapping string as a sensitive credential - do not store it in shared locations or check it into source control.
     - Please remember to provide an initial password. Although the system will require a password change, it is still a "live" password and can be used to login to the default user "ubuntu".
     As a security measure, password based SSH login is disabled by default.

1. **Post-Install Settings**  
   Although Service Edge is expected to be up and running automatically, it might be necessary to perform a few post-install setting manually.
   - Reset default user's password. It is a good idea to validate that you can use the specified default password login and take the opportunity to reset that password.
   - Network settings. By default we assume that network setting is DHCP. If you use static IP configuration, you need to set it manually.
      - Add a config under `/etc/netplan`. You can use the template provided by us at `/etc/netplan/80-static-ip.yaml`
      - Make the change take effect by running `sudo netplan apply`
   - Allow SSH login through password. **Doing this may increase security risk, please consider alternatives.**
      - Find the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf` and change the option `PasswordAuthentication` to `yes`.
      - Make the change take effect by running `sudo systemctl restart ssh`
   - (Optional) Check and apply OS hardening settings.
      - We preloaded ansible playbook from [ansible-lockdown](https://github.com/ansible-lockdown/UBUNTU24-CIS) to harden the Ubuntu VM according to [CIS benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks). You can run `ansible-playbook -v hardening-site.yml` under the `/root` directory to apply the OS hardening settings.

1. **Verify SE Connection Status**  
   The bootstrapping process may take a few minutes, depending on network connectivity. Once completed, the SE should appear as connected in the Mammoth Cyber Management Portal.

1. **(Optional) Adjust VM Settings**  
   - Check and adjust network settings, memory and CPU for the new VM.  
   - Default configurations are sufficient for most cases, but monitor the VM's performance and adjust resources as needed to handle traffic load effectively.

By following these steps, you can successfully deploy our pre-built SE on VMware.
