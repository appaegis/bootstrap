# Deploy SE on VMware by Creating a New Virtual Machine

This guide explains how to set up a new virtual machine (VM) dedicated to the Service Edge (SE) function within your VMware infrastructure.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Choose an Ubuntu LTS Image**  
   To create a new Linux VM, use an Ubuntu LTS image in OVA format for quick deployment. For example, visit the [`Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)`](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/) page and note the URL of the [`OVA build`](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.ova). 

1. **(Optional) Download the OVA File**  
   Downloading the OVA file is optional, since some VMware products allow you to load the OVA directly using its URL.

1. **Create the Virtual Machine**  
   - Use the downloaded OVA file or the OVA URL to create the VM.  
   - During setup, provide the bootstrapping string (Base64 encoded) as the user data.  
     - Obtain the bootstrapping string from the **"Networking â†’ Service Edges"** section of the Mammoth Cyber Management Portal.  
     - **Important:** Since the bootstrapping string contains unique identifiers, do not reuse it unless replacing an existing SE after stopping it. Treat the bootstrapping string as a sensitive credential - do not store it in shared locations or check it into source control.

1. **Verify SE Connection Status**  
   The bootstrapping process may take a few minutes, depending on network connectivity. Once completed, the SE should appear as connected in the Mammoth Cyber Management Portal.

1. **(Optional) Adjust VM Settings**  
   - Check and adjust network settings, memory, CPU, and disk allocations for the new VM.  
   - Default configurations are sufficient for most cases, but monitor the VM's performance and adjust resources as needed to handle traffic load effectively.

By following these steps, you can successfully deploy an SE on VMware.
